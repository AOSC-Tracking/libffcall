This directory contains a set of ‘config.cache’ files for different platforms.
It is not actually used. The only purpose of saving these files is to have
a reference for questions like
"Does AIX c89 return small structs in registers?"
"Does HP-UX have mmap?"

To create such a config.cache, use the configure option '-C'.
When storing it in this directory, use the naming scheme
  ABI-OS[-<other details>]
where:
  ABI = ${gl_cv_host_cpu_c_abi}
  OS = the third component of ${ac_cv_host_os}
