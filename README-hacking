All you need to know when hacking (modifying) GNU libffcall or when building
it off the git repository.


Requirements
============

You will need reasonably recent versions of the build tools:

  * A C compiler. Such as GNU GCC.
    + Homepage:
      http://gcc.gnu.org/

  * GNU automake
    + Homepage:
      http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/

  * GNU autoconf
    + Homepage:
      http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/

  * GNU m4
    + Homepage:
      http://www.gnu.org/software/m4/

  * GNU groff 1.17 or newer
    + Homepage:
      http://www.gnu.org/software/groff/

  * Either an internet connection or a recent copy of GNU gnulib.
    + Homepage:
      http://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/

  * GNU tar (for creating distributable tarballs)
    + Homepage:
      http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/

And, of course, the packages listed in the DEPENDENCIES file.


Building off the git repository
===============================

Access to the git repository is described at
  http://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=libffcall

After fetching the sources from the repository, peek at the comments in
autogen.sh, then run "./autogen.sh"; then you can proceed with "./configure"
as usual.
