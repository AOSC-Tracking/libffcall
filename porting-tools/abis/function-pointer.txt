Function pointers
=================

On all platforms, a function pointer has the same size as a data pointer (void*).

You can determine what a function pointer actually is by compiling
trampoline/proto.c (for 32-bit platforms) or
trampoline/proto64.c (for 64-bit platforms)
with -O -fomit-frame-pointer -S and looking at the resulting output,
especially of function 'tramp'.

On most platforms, function pointers are just a pointer to the code, i.e. to
the first instruction to be executed.

On powerpc-aix and powerpc64-aix, a function pointer is actually a pointer to a
struct {
  void* code_address;
  void* toc_pointer;  /* gets loaded into register r2 */
  void* static_chain; /* gets loaded into register r11 */
}.

Likewise on powerpc64-linux (but not on powerpc-linux and
not on powerpc64-elfv2-linux!).

On ia64 (both ia64-linux and ia64-hpux), a function pointer is actually
a pointer to a
struct {
  void* code_address;
  void* global_pointer; /* for PIC code, gets loaded into register r1 */
}.

Similarly on ia64-ilp32-hpux; here the struct contains two 8-byte pointers,
although an ordinary pointer is only 4 bytes wide.

On hppa, you don't see anything from the .s file, because the interesting
details are hidden in a function named $$dyncall. You need to compile funcptr.s
and actually look at the values in the debugger.
A function pointer is a pointer to a
struct {
  void* code_address;
  void* pic_base; /* for PIC code, gets loaded into register r19 */
}, plus 2 (misaligned!).

On hppa64, a function pointer is a pointer to a
struct {
  void* some_other_code_address;
  void* some_other_pic_base;
  void* code_address;
  void* pic_base; /* for PIC code, gets loaded into register r27 */
}.
