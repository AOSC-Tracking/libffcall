Generic QEMU tricks
===================

Some tricks regarding the configuration of a QEMU target machine.

Display
-------

* "-display gtk" is comfortable.
* "-display vnc:14" is also possible, then view the screen with
  "krdc vnc://localhost:14"
* On some machines (e.g. mips), there is no graphics card, therefore you don't
  see anything in the display; the only meaningful option is "-nographic".

Monitor
-------

The option "-monitor stdio" is nice, so that I can see the kernel output in
the window.
But when it is not possible (due to -nographic option):

C-a h    print this help
C-a x    exit emulator
C-a s    save disk data back to file (if -snapshot)
C-a t    toggle console timestamps
C-a b    send break (magic sysrq)
C-a c    switch between console and monitor
C-a C-a  sends C-a

Networking
----------

The two main kinds of network interface are "-netdev user" and "-netdev tap".
* "-netdev user" does not require any configuration. The drawback is that
  the target machine does not accept incoming network connections. I.e.
  no ssh from the host to the guest, only ssh from the guest to the host.
* "-netdev tap" virtually clumps the guest's ethernet card on the host's
  ethernet card. The drawbacks are:
    - It does not work when the host is connecting to the internet through
      wifi, only if the host is connecting through an ethernet card.
    - It requires configuration.

Tips for "-netdev user":
* Don't specify a network interface. The default is
  (POSSIBLY equivalent to SOMETHING LIKE
   "-netdev user,id=net0 -device e1000,netdev=net0,mac=52:54:00:12:34:56")
    hub 0
     \ hub0port1: user.0: index=0,type=user,net=10.0.2.0,restrict=off
     \ hub0port0: e1000.0: index=0,type=nic,model=e1000,macaddr=52:54:00:12:34:56
  which produces an outgoing connection.
* The built-in router DNS server in QEMU produce this network topology:
    guest ip address = 10.0.2.15 (assigned by DHCP server)
    host = gateway = DHCP server = 10.0.2.2
    DNS server = 10.0.2.3
    SMB server (optional) = 10.0.2.4
  and I can access not only the internet, but also the host:
    $ ssh bruno@10.0.2.2
  The topology is like this:
    10.0.2.15 -> local network 10.0.2.*
                 gateway 10.0.2.2       -> local network of my host
                                           gateway of my host       -> internet

Tips for "-netdev tap":
* Give each machine its own macaddr, in case I want to run them at the same
  time.

Useful monitor commands:
  info network  -- show the network state
  info usernet  -- show user network stack connection states

Safe rebooting
--------------

On Linux, use "sudo reboot".
On BSD systems, logout, login as root and do "reboot".
Don't use "shutdown" or "halt" - because in some systems, this only switches
to a different runlevel and does not reboot.

When rebooting, you see a flood of kernel messages, each prefixed with a
number [xxxxxx.yyy], which is the number of seconds since boot. When these
numbers have restarted near 0, a new boot is in progress. It's safe to
turn off the machne then (within ca. 3 seconds of boot start).
